<h1><b>DESCRIPITION:</b><h1>

 
<p><h3>Vadapalani Andavar Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Muruga. It is located in Vadapalani, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. It was renovated in the 1920s and a Rajagopuram was built during that time. The temple has grown in popularity, which is believed to be in part due to the patronage of cinema stars. The temple was built in the late 19th century by an ardent devotee of Murugan, Annaswami Nayakar. He was a staunch devotee of Murugan and had built a small, thatched hut in which he placed a painted portrait of Murugan and started worshipping him. Although he suffered from an acute stomach- ailment, he went on a pilgrimage visiting all Murugan temples, braving bad weather, and thieves. One day, a Sadhu (sage) appeared in his dream and said Murugan was right in his home for worship.
