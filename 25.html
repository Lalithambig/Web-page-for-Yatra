<h1><b>DESCRIPITION:</b><h1>

 
<p><h3>There are about nine monolithic temples at Mahabalipuram. They are the unique contribution of the Pallavas to Indian Art. The monolithic temples are called locally as Ratha (Chariot) as they resemble the processional chariots of a temple. The Five rathas, the best of all monolithic temples, are hewn out of a huge boulder. Temples of different plan and elevation have been carved and the left over portions were intelligently used to carve animals in a natural way. The naming of these ratha, after Pandavas and their wife, the heroes of epic Mahabharata, is simply a local tradition. General view of the Monolithic temples, known as Five Rathas, From left to right: Draupadi, Nakula-Sahadeva, Bhima and Dharmaraja Rathas. Among the Five rathas, Dharmaraja ratha is the most impressive and sculpturally rich. The tritala (three storeyed) vimana, square in its talas but octagonal in the griva sikhara region, faces west.The sculptures around the sanctum in the corner blocks depict simple forms of Siva, Harihara, Brahma-Sasta, Brahma, a delicately balanced representation of Ardhanarisvara besides a portrait of a king, possibly Narasimhavarman I himself above which his titles Sri Megha and Trailokiya â€“vardhana-vidhi are inscribed. The upper floors, a veritable gallery of images, have excellently modelled images of Siva as Gangadara, the earliest representation of Siva as Natesa in the Tamil country, Vrishbantika, Kankalamurti, Vishnu resting on Garuda, and Kaliyamardhana. An inscription gives the name of the sanctum in the uppermost tier as Atyantakama Pallavesvaram, Atyantakama being a title of Paramesvaravarman I.
