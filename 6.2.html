<p><h3>Chenthilandavar Temple, Tiruchendur is an ancient Hindu temple dedicated to Murugan. It is second among six abodes of Murugan (Arupadaiveedugal) situated in Tamil Nadu, India. This temple is the fourth Hindu temple in Tamil Nadu to get ISO certification. The temple, which is built near the seashore, measures 91 m (299 ft) north to south, 65 m (213 ft) east to west, and has a nine-tier gopuram, or tower gate, that is 157 feet (48 meters) high. The principal entrance faces south, and opens into the first of two prakarams, the first of which is lined with rows of Yalis. The inner sanctum of the temple is in a cave and the main deity, or moolavar, is Murugan as a saintly child, portrayed in a granite carving.[5] Naazhi Kinaru, a sacred well fed by a freshwater spring, is located 100 m (330 ft) south of the temple. Devotees undergo a ritual cleansing by bathing in water from the well after bathing in the ocean.
