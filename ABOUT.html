<h1 class="head">ABOUT</h1>
<h2>Tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes.</h2><br><br>

<h2>It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together according to Hindu faith. Inside its garbhagriha innermost sanctum, a Hindu temple contains a murti or Hindu god's image. Hindu temples are large and magnificent with a rich history.</h2><br><br>

<h2>A temple is a place of blessings, where everyone comes with a positive thought creating a wave of positivity in the temple space. This helps calm our minds and absorb more positive vibrations and energy. Temple rituals are not blind traditions that are followed by droves of believers without any thought behind them.</h2>

<h2>A temple is a building that people use for worshipping gods or for other religious purposes. The houses of worship in many ancient religions were called temples. Hinduism, Buddhism, and several other religions today also have temples. The architecture, or building style, of temples varies from place to place.</h2>
