<p><h3>The Venugopala Swamy Temple located at Hosa Kannambadi, near Krishna Raja Sagara, is an example of Hoysala architecture in Karnataka, India. This temple was built in the 12th century AD around the same time as the Chennakesava Temple at Somanathapura, Mysore district. The complex was a symmetrical building enclosed by two 'prakaras' and the outer gate (Mahadwara) had verandahs on both sides, flanked by the yagasala and the kitchen. This was enclosed by the second mahadwara, which led to the inner enclosure and was akin to the Somanathapura temple. The temple had a garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), a vestibule, a middle hall and a mukhya mantapa (main hall). The cell opposite to the entrance had a figure of Kesava (Lord Krishna) and the south cell, containing the figure of Gopalakrishna, was a later addition.
