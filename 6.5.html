<h1><b>DESCRIPITION:</b><h1>

 
<p><h3>The hill has 365 steps indicating 365 days of the year. It is fifth among the six abodes of Murugan (Arupadai Vidu) The other five are Palani Murugan Temple, Swamimalai Murugan Temple, Thiruchendur Murugan Temple, Thiruparankundram and Pazhamudircholai Murugan Temple. Thiruttani is 87 kilometres (54 mi) from Chennai. It is the only adobe located within the Greater Chennai Metropolitan Area limit. During the Sangam era, Thiruttani was known as Kundruthoradal. After killing the asura Tarakasura in Tiruchendur, he came here to subside his anger, so Surasamharam is not conducted here. According to the regional legend of the temple, Indra, the king of the devas gave his daughter Devasena in marriage to Murugan, and along with her presented his elephant Airavata as part of his offering. Upon Airavata's departure, Indra found his wealth waning. Murugan is said to have offered to return the white elephant, however Indra bound by protocol refused to accept a gift that he had made, and insisted that the elephant face his direction, hence the image of the elephant in this temple also faces the east.
