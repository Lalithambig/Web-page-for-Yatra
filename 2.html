<h1><b>DESCRIPITION:</b></h1>

 
<p><h3>According to the Puranas, Parvati worshipped Shiva in the form of a peacock, giving the vernacular name Mylai (Mayilāi) to the area that developed around the temple – mayil is Tamil for "peacock". Shiva is worshiped as Kapaleeshwarar, and is represented by the lingam. His consort Parvati is depicted as Karpagambal. he Kapaleeshwarar temple is of typical Dravidian architectural style, with the gopuram overpowering the street on which the temple sits. This temple is also a testimonial for the vishvakarmas sthapathis. There are two entrances to the temple marked by the gopuram on either side. The east gopuram is about 40 m high, while the smaller western gopuram faces the sacred tank.</h3></p>
