<p><h3>The temple is fourth abode of Murugan among six (Arupadaiveedugal). The temple has three gopuram (gateway towers), three precincts and sixty steps and each one is named after the sixty Tamil years. The annual Vaikasi Visagam festival is attended by thousands of devotees from far and near. As per Hindu legend, Muruga, the son of Shiva, extolled the meaning of the Pranava Mantra (AUM) to his father at this place and hence attained the name Swaminathaswamy. The temple is believed to be in existence from the Sangam period from 2nd century BC and was believed to have been modified and rebuilt by Parantaka Chola I. The temple was greatly damaged during the Anglo-French war between Hyder Ali and British in 1740.
