<p><h3>Brihadishvara Temple, called Rajarajesvaram (lit. 'Lord of Rajaraja') by its builder, and known locally as Thanjai Periya Kovil (lit. 'Thanjavur Big Temple') and Peruvudaiyar Kovil, is a Shaivite[3][4] Hindu temple built in a Chola architectural style[5] located on the south bank of the Cauvery river in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu, India.[ The original monuments of this 11th-century temple were built around a moat. It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes, and sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnavism and Shaktism. The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing. The original monuments of this 11th-century temple were built around a moat.
