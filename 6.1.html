<p><h3>Arulmigu Murugan Temple, Thiruparankundram is a Tamil temple dedicated to the god Murugan (also known as Kartikeya and Murugan) at Thiruparankundram, Tamilnadu, India. It is regarded as one of the "six Abodes of Murugan". As per Hindu legend, the demon king Surapadman, once obtained boons from the god Shiva on account of severe penance. He started ruling the 1008 worlds on account of the power attained. He married Padumakomalai and had several sons. Viramkendiram, a city created in the seas, became his capital and he started troubling the devas (the gods). He imprisoned Indra (the king of the gods) and also desired Indra's wife Indrani. Indra sought the help of Shiva's son and the god of war Murugan. Murugan sent his messenger Viravakutevar to the demon, who remained unmoved. A severe battle was fought in Thiruparamkundram where Murugan killed all the sons of the Surapadman except Iraniyan. Surapadman hid under the sea. Murugan split him into two pieces, which went on to become the god's divine vehicles, peacock and rooster.
